# API-less YouTube Uploader

This project provides a way to upload videos to YouTube without using the YouTube API. It uses the YouTube web interface to perform the upload, so it can be used in cases where the YouTube API is not available or cannot be used.

## Getting Started

To use the API-less YouTube Uploader, you will need to download and install the following software:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/downloads/)
- [Selenium for Java](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/)

## Usage

Once you have these dependencies installed, you can build the project using the following command:


```
java Youtu <path-to-video-file> <youtube-username> <youtube-password> <video-title> <video-description>
```
